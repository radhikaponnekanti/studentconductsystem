### 2.2 New Process Requirements ###

##### System Requirements #####
The application must run on all standards compliant web browsers for all operating systems. System must also be available for use 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

##### Data Requirements #####
All data collected on the current forms (i.e. incident location, date and time, students involved, charges, sanctions, fines, etc.).

##### Security Requirements #####
The data needs to be delivered securely over the web using SSL and the application must be secured and only available from behind the company firewall.

There should also be several levels of access. Administrator, high level access to all information and functionality within the system. This access level would include delete functionality. Mid level access to most information and functionality within the system. Basic, low level access. Very limited access to the system, for example, only having the ability to create incident reports.

##### Support Requirements #####

<h3>2.3 Business Impact</h3>
By using a computer based system report handling will be much more efficient and conducive to all parties involved. The time it takes to process incident reports will be dramatically reduced, since the majority of time spent during processing is closely related to documentation handling. Furthermore, a system with increased accessibility and organization will enhance case reviewing procedures, scheduling, and sanction tracking updates.<br>
<br>
<h4>2.3.1 Metrics to Measure Business Impact</h4>
<ul>
<li>Time spent handling/organizing documentation</li>
<li>Budget spent on paper</li>
<li>Incident reviewing quality and speed</li>
<li>Amount of meeting rescheduling</li>
<li>Sanction tracking updates</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.3.2 Business Dependencies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Users must enter accurate incident report information into program.</li>
<li>Users must be trained in program functionality.</li>
<li>IT maintenance must be trained in program specific troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.3.3 Business Risks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Current employees unable to assimilate new system in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Case reviewing unable to keep up with incident processing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4 Technology Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Department copy machine usage will decrease significantly.</li>
<li>Fax machines will no longer be main entity for transferring documentation.</li>
<li>Computer usage will increase and become prominent.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.4.1 Technology Dependencies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Up-to-date working computers and internet access. </li>
</ul>

<h4>2.4.2 Technology Risks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Server crashes</li>
<li>Computer crashes </li>
