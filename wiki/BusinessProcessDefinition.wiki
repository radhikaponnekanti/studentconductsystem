<li>The system needs to be accessible from anywhere at anytime</li>
<li>The data in the system needs to be secure</li>
<li>The data in the system needs to be stored in a central location</li>
<li>Ability to create and track incident reports</li>
<li>Ability to create and track incidents</li>
<li>Ability to create and track cases through adjudication(charges, sanctions, appeals)</li>

===2.2 New Process Requirements===

=====Business Requirements=====
e.g. “need to provide a 30 day turnaround from application to approval.”

=====System Requirements=====
e.g. “24 by 7 system availability 6days per week”

=====Reporting Requirements=====
e.g. “Report to produce a count of new applications by state for each week by application type”

=====Data Requirements=====
e.g. “based on fields in the report, need specific data elements from the following data sources “

=====Security Requirements=====
The need for securing the system to be developed should be stated in section including levels of access that can be granted
e.g. “headquarters’ staff may have read only access the following specific data measures”

=====Personnel Requirements=====
The following table should contain a list of everyone who will play a role in the development of the system.		
		
=====Support Requirements=====
The following table should contain a list of everyone who will play a role in the ongoing maintenance of the system following implementation.

===2.3 Business Impact===
By using a computer based system report handling will be much more efficient and conducive to all parties involved. The time it takes to process incident reports will be dramatically reduced, since the majority of time spent during processing is closely related to documentation handling. Furthermore, a system with increased accessibility and organization will enhance case reviewing procedures, scheduling, and sanction tracking updates.

====2.3.1 Metrics to Measure Business Impact====
<ul>
<li>Time spent handling/organizing documentation</li>
<li>Budget spent on paper</li>
<li>Incident reviewing quality and speed</li>
<li>Amount of meeting rescheduling</li>
<li>Sanction tracking updates</li>
</ul>

====2.3.2 Business Dependencies====
<ul>
<li>Users must enter accurate incident report information into program.</li>
<li>Users must be trained in program functionality.</li>
<li>IT maintenance must be trained in program specific troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>

====2.3.3 Business Risks====
<ul>
<li>Current employees unable to assimilate new system in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Case reviewing unable to keep up with incident processing.</li>
</ul>

===2.4 Technology Impact===
<ul>
<li>Department copy machine usage will decrease significantly.</li>
<li>Fax machines will no longer be main entity for transferring documentation.</li>
<li>Computer usage will increase and become prominent.</li>
</ul>

====2.4.1 Technology Dependencies====
<ul>
<li>Up-to-date working computers and internet access. </li>
</ul>

====2.4.2 Technology Risks====
<ul>
<li>Server crashes</li>
<li>Computer crashes </li>
<li>Network security breach</li>
</ul>
