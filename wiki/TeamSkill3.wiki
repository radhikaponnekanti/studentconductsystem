===3.3 Summary of Capabilities===

The capabilities of the system refers to the features listed in the Team Skill2.The capabilities will be designed and developed according to the priority decided in the requirement workshop. We are also keen to discuss the same with our stakeholders to finalize the capabilities and decide on the iteration phases for each requirement.

To summarize, we have the following capabilities our product will be able to perform. 

Student Conduct Information System will have capabilities like handling the details of the incident reports and cases.

===3.4 Assumptions and Dependencies===

====Assumptions====

As a development team, legal and regulatory regulations are not considered. It is assumed that all the hardware requirements are taken care of by the stakeholders. 

====Dependencies====

Each phase is completed with an acceptance test by the stakeholders. The dependency on hardware requirements is to be considered by the stakeholders. 

===3.5 Cost and Pricing===

The team consisting of marketing executives and system analysts will analyze cost and pricing of the product. The cost of softwares purchased for interfacing, cost of wages to develop the product will be considered for the pricing. The factors of considered for calculation of cost are number of employees working on the project, number of hours covered in terms of effort, various taxes, supporting software tools cost etc . The approximate price to build the product is mentioned to the stakeholders verbally. The document tracking the expense and budget will be produced soon once the requirement capture is completed. 

==4. Feature Attributes==

===4.1 Status===

A shared folder is maintained a common and secure server to highlight the status of the project. The folder is accessible to privileged people in both developer and stakeholder team. Here all the requirement documents are maintained. 

===4.2 Priority===

The priority features analyzed in the team skill2 and all the baseline requirements will be developed. 

===4.3 Effort===

The development team is responsible to maintain a time sheet for each team member working in the project to put in the number of hours he/she worked. 

===4.4 Risk===

The risk (if any) in developing each feature for the project is analyzed and documented. 

===4.5 Stability===

Features are stable and any change in requirement from the stakeholder will be considered as enhancements. The stable and clear set of requirements are considered for the release in the first phase and ambiguous requirements are investigated more and taken in next phases.

===4.6 Target Release===

Release of phase 1 is likely to take 2 months i.e. phase 1 should be ready for acceptance test by December. 

===4.7 Assigned To===

The requirements analyzed are handed over to the software team to start the elaboration phase for all the requirements that are feasible and clear in requirement statement.
