<h3>Plagiarism</h3>
<h4>Explain plagiarism -- Use your own words</h4>

Plagiarism is the theft of other people's unique ideas and words. People plagiarize when they copy from another person and do not give them appropriate credit for their original work.<br>
<br>
<h4>List five plagiarism behaviors</h4>

<ol>
<li>The writer copies sentences, words, or ideas and revises them so that they look like they are their own without giving credit to the original author.</li>
<li>The writer copies exact content from another source, gives credit to the original author, but does not put the content in quotes.</li>
<li>The writer gets their information from the internet but does not include a date. Content on the internet is constantly changing. (Stepchyshyn & Nelson, 2007)</li>
<li>Defending your position on a paper you're writing using someone else’s ideas without  giving them credit is plagiarism. </li>
<li>Paraphrasing information from a source without referencing that source is plagiarism.</li>
</ol>

<h4>List  at least five behaviors that are not  plagiarism</h4>

<ol>
<li>Copying another writers words, ideas, etc., but citing and quoting them appropriately.</li>
<li>Revising another writers words, sentences, etc. and citing them appropriately.</li>
<li>Writing, using you own ideas and interpretation of the topic.</li>
<li>Discussing another individual’s work in your own words and giving them credit for it by citing their work.</li>
<li>Supporting an argument using someone else’s ideas and giving them credit for those ideas.</li>
</ol>

<h4>How to avoid plagiarism</h4>
The first defense against plagiarism is to understand exactly what it is. Secondly, Educate yourself! Educate yourself on the topic you are writing on. Know and understand the material. Try to think for yourself, come up with your own ideas and put them into your own words. If you use other sources for your writing, make sure you always cite them appropriately.<br>
